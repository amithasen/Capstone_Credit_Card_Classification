# Capstone: Credit Card Classification

## Business Problem/Summary:
My project goal is try and shine some more light on the way credit card approval algorithms make their decision to approve or deny someone for a credit card.

For a long time these credit card algorithms have been a black box to everyone but a select few. The general public is on the outside trying to look in the boxes to see what exactly qualifies someone (or not) for a credit card.

I am testing out various models to see how well they work with a data set that contains information that would be submitted by someone applying for a credit card online. Then from each of the best perfoming alogorithms I display which features (columns of data) each model used the most to the least. I also have an overall look at feature importance for the entire data set.

After a best performing model has been selected and optimized as well as the top most relevant features selected, I aim to have a Flask web app that will act and look like an online credit card application website. This web app will allow users to input their information and 'run' the model to see if they would be approved or denied a credit card.
